# Jarrett's First CS 193 Homework

- I really enjoy the interesting names of files and directories throughout the slideshows.
- The slides are also very well done, providing good information while still being visually appealing.
- The videos provided are also very helpful, such as the video showing a graphical file system equivalent to the `mv` command in terminal.
